# Changelog

Changelog for the AISL project.

## 0.0.1 - 2017-12-22
### Added
- First WIP release of the project following Sprint 1!
- Created four screens: backend, endline, make-a-vis, and mockup. Backend shows debug messages demonstrating that messages are being generated. Endline is the screen for the Run exhibit showing the runners' run times. Make-a-vis is the screen where users can create visualizations from the data generated by runners. Mockup is the screen showing a mockup of the make-a-vis screen (used for styling and research related to the looks of the site).
- Endline is fully utilizing the messages generated by the backend, while make-a-vis is still in process for fully utilizing the data. Mockup does not use any 'live' data.
- Each screen can be compiled to run just that screen for deployment/kiosk purposes.
- Created a [demo site](https://cns-iu.github.io/aisl/) for presenting the four screens created during Sprint 1.
